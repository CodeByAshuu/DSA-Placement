#                                           - - - INHERITANCE - - -

Inheritance allows one class (derived class) to acquire properties and behaviors of another class (base class).
- Promotes code reusability
- Supports polymorphism
- Implements IS-A relationship

❗Effect of visibility mode
Base Member	    Public Inheritance	Protected Inheritance	Private Inheritance
public	        public	            protected	            private
protected	    protected	        protected	            private
private	        ❌ Not inherited	  ❌ Not inherited	     ❌ Not inherited


✅CONTRUCTOR DESTRUCTOR ORDER
Order of execution:
- Base constructor runs first
- Then derived constructor
- On destruction → reverse order
ex: 
    Base()
    Derived()
    ~Derived()
    ~Base()


✅ Diamond Problem
Two copies of base class is copied - ambiguity
solution ? virtual inheritance using 'virtual' keyword


✅ OBJECT SLICING
When a derived class object is assigned to a base class variable , Extra derived data is sliced off:
Base b = Derived();


✅ Important MCQ points:
- Constructors are not inherited
- Destructors are not inherited
- Copy constructor not inherited
- Assignment operator not inherited

✅ FUNCTION OVERRIDING
Same function name + same signature in base and derived class.
- Achieved using virtual function for runtime polymorphism
- Late binding occurs

Rule:
virtual void show();
void show() override;


✅ COMPOSITION vs INHERITANCE

Inheritance = IS-A
Composition = HAS-A (preferred)
Important interview question:
Use inheritance when behavior is shared, not just data.


✅ Friendship is not inherited.

✅ STATIC MEMBER IN INHERITANCE
- Inherited
- Shared across all objects
- Accessed via derived class too

✅ BASE INHERITED USING PROTECTED
If derived class inherits base using protected mode:
Public → becomes protected
Protected → stays protected

✅ CONSTRUCTOR IN MULTIPLE INHERITANCE

Order follows class order in declaration, not initialization list.
class D : public B, public C {};
Order:
B()
C()
D()

✅ FINAL KEYWORD
Stops inheritance or overriding.
class A final { };
virtual void show() final;


🔥 Common MCQ Traps
Private members are not inherited
Constructor order is always base → derived
Virtual function call through base pointer uses vtable
Without virtual destructor, deleting derived via base pointer is undefined behavior
Virtual inheritance solves diamond problem
Overloading ≠ Overriding
Static function cannot be virtual
Abstract class cannot have objects
